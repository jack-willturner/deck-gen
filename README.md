# deck-gen
Sentence mining from the subtitles of your favourite TV shows for language learning via Anki decks.   

Very basic functionality: put the `.xml` subtitle files into the `xml` directory. Run `python generator.py`. Import your newly generated deck into Anki and enjoy :)  
  

Future ideas:
- [ ] Tags by episode
- [ ] Difficulty heuristic 
- [ ] Separate vocabulary decks
- [ ] Audio
